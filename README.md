# GraphRTC

<span style="color:crimson">
The server is not doing anything nor storing anything, we just pass the informations beetween the particiapants
</span>

**_Probability of 2 users generating the same Uuid is very low._**

## How does it work?

A user create a room.

He access this room.

When the user is in the room he starts listening for new participants.

The user that try to join a room wait for the websocket to connect and then send the joinRoom event.

When a particiant join the room he sent to all the other participants listening to this room his Uuid generated by the client.

The latest to arrive is always the callee, the others are the callers.

### Caller

The caller send an offer to the callee with the uuid he received.

The caller now listen to the answer of the callee.

Then they both exchange the candidates to connect the two peers.

### Callee

The callee subscribe to the offers with his uuid and the room uuid.

The callee send an answer to the caller.

Then they both exchange the candidates to connect the two peers.
